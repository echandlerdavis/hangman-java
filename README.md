* Guess individual characters 
* If the character is in the generated word, it will fill in the blank
* If the character is not in the generated word, it will be added to the misses, and a portion of the hangman will show on the board
* The user wins if they can guess the word before the drawing of the hangman is complete
* If the user guesses incorrectly 6 times, the drawing of the hangman is completed and they lose.
